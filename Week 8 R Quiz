Q1. Illustrate how to add element by element the contents of two numeric vectors of equal length using a for loop. Comment on how this differs from the easieer vector addition method preferred in R.

```{r}

vec1 <- 1:10
vec2 <- 10:1
vec0 <- as.numeric()

for (i in 1:10){
    sum <- vec1[i] + vec2[i]
    vec0 <- c(vec0, sum)
}

vec1
vec2
vec0

```

Q2. Write code that uses a while loop that determines how many "heads" in a row an arbitrary vector of coin flips has starting at the beginning. An example of a vector input is c("heads","heads","tails","heads"). Your code should give an answer of 2 when run on this vector. Note that a vector that begins with "tails" should give an answer of 0.

```{r}

## heads = 1, tails = 0
## must use while loop

toss <- function(x) {
        flips <- rbinom(x,1,0.5)
        print('Here are your fair flips:', quote=F)
        print(flips)
        heads <- 0
        i <- 1
        while (i < (length(flips))) {
            if(!flips[i]==1){
                i <- (i+1)
            } else {
                if(!flips[i]==flips[i+1]) {
                    i <- (i+1)
                } else {
                    heads <- (heads+1)
                    i <- (i+1)
            }
        }
    }
        print('Count of consecutive heads:', quote=F)
        print(heads)
}

toss(20)

```

Q3. Use a for loop running over all 100 integers from 1 to 100 and the ifelse() function to add only the odd numbers from 1 to 100.

```{r}

## x is vector 1:100; can be any vector of integers, though.
## constructed to show vector of odds

vec <- 1:100

oddball <- function(x) {
    require(gtools)
    temp <- as.numeric()
    for (i in 1:length(x)) {
        ifelse(odd(x[i]), temp <- c(temp, x[i]), temp<-temp)
        }
    grandtotal <- sum(temp)
    print('The odd numbers: ', quote=F)
    print(temp)
    print('The grand total: ', quote=F)
    print(grandtotal)
}

oddball(vec)

```

BONUS: Can you show how to accomplish the same thing without using a loop?

```{r}

#vectorize, baby, vectorize

odderstill <- sum(seq(1,100,by=2))
odderstill

```
